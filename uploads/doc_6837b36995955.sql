Weakness in the price of oil created difficulties for oil exporting developing countries&rsquo;&rsquo;.</p>\r\n<p>Reporting specifically on Nigeria, the bank stated that`` foreign exchange resource declined in 1982 from a level equivalent to three month worth.&nbsp;<br>Investment, equal to about a third of gross domestics product (GDP) in 1980 &ndash;1981, has been radically reduced as both foreign exchange and government resource contract (85% of government revenue, both federal and states are direct generated from oil export).</p>\r\n<p>An attempt to wriggle the country out of its financial predicament led to the initially of series of belt-tighten measure since 1982 to date. &nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>These measure include Ban on import of a large number of goods, specially taxes on luxury goods, enforcement of trick exchanges control reputation liberalized during the earlier boom, wages and ban on employment in the public sector, increased external borrowing in anticipation of oil income and of late the introduction of value added tax (v.a.t).&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>The impact of the dwindling revenues to the federal government and this ever decreasing portion &nbsp;of statutory allocation to states, has aroused tremendous interest in other source of revenue. Therefore, the hitherto relaxed tax laws are vigorously being enforced while levies of various descriptions are also being in various state of the federation.</p>\r\n<p>Nsukka local government area of Enugu state is not exempted from this nation economic recession. One of the major sources of revenue to the local government, second to statutory allocation from the state and federal &nbsp;government, is the personal income tax (PIT) impose on all taxable persons in the local &nbsp;government. The personal income tax is allocated either through the Pay-As-You-Earn (PAYE) system in which employers of labour deduct tax due from the income of their employees and remit it to the division.</p>\r\n<p>In this study, my interest lies in appraising the effective and efficiency of Pay-As-You-Earn (PAYE) as a system of tax collection. The examination of the weakness interest in the system will be carried out and based on empincal observation, make suitable recommendation as to how loopholes in the system could be plugged especially at this time of wide spread awareness of the great potentials of internally generally revenues.</p>\r\n<p>1.1 STATEMENT OF PROBLEM<br>&nbsp;<br>The expectation of the public from governments (local, state and federal) in the developing countries are such that the later are saddle with responsibilities for the provision of various services. The 1979 nigeria constitution sec.16 (a) state. Quite clearly that ``the state shall control the national economy in such manner as to secure the maximum welfare, freedom and happiness of every citizen as the basic of social justice and equality of status and opportunities&rsquo;&rsquo;.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br>It is in an attempt to fulfill these expectation and sometimes constitutionals requirement that government rely on, among either source, the imposition of various taxes, weather direct or indirect on the defined taxable persons in their territory. Such tax and poll tax<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br>These taxes are collected at source at source include taxes on dividend interest and rates. Also induction is tax on personal income tax through the Pay-As-You-Earn (PAYE) system has been effective in achieving its objectives of minimizing collection costs and reduction tax evasion &nbsp;while increasing revenue to the local government. We will all look into the problem of the pay-As-You-Earn system and suggest measures to solve such problems that might be identified.</p>\r\n<p>1.2 PURPOSE OF THE STUDY</p>\r\n<p>The purpose of the study can be broken down vas follows:</p>\r\n<p>(a) &nbsp; &nbsp;to ascertain the impact of &nbsp;Pay-As-You-Earn system effectiveness on personal income tax revenue over a period of ten years.<br>(b) &nbsp; &nbsp;To educate the truthfulness of the data provided by tax &ndash; payers in their tax return and ascertain the percentage of those who do not provide the information there in.<br>(c) &nbsp; &nbsp;To find out weather there is any relationship between the truthfulness of information provided by tax payers in their tax returns and their age.<br>(d) &nbsp; &nbsp;To identify the problem (if any) encountered by the internal revenue division and the employers of labour in the application of the PAYE system.<br>(e) &nbsp; &nbsp;To find out how the employers perceive the PAYE system and the likely improvement that they would recommend.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br>On the basis of my findings, suggestion and recommendation will be made which I hope would be benefit to the local government it is also hope that future researcher in the area of the public finance would find the work a valuable source of literature.</p>\r\n<p>1.3 SIGNIFICANT</p>\r\n<p>The significance of adequate revenue for a developing economy such as that of Nigeria cannot be over emphasized. This study is being conducted with a view to exposing the inherent weakness on the Pay-As-You-Earn system of taxation.</p>\r\n<p>The suggestion and recommendation made on how loopholes in the system could be plugged. Especially at this time of widespread weakness of the great potential of internally generated revenue would be very beneficial to the governments.</p>\r\n<p>The local government will find it very useful in drawing up revenue and other methods of taxation which will in turn check the ever dividing revenue to the government.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>1.4 STATEMENT OF THE HYPOTHENSIS</p>\r\n<p>A hypothesis is a rational assumption, which subject to fast could be true or false</p>\r\n<p>The following hypothesis were made as a guide for this research ho (i) The effectiveness of the Pay-As-You-Earn system has not affected personal income tax revenue.</p>\r\n<p>Hi (ii) the effectiveness of the Pay-As-You-Earn system has affected &nbsp;personal income tax revenue</p>\r\n<p>1.5 SCOPE OF STUDY</p>\r\n<p>The study shall be confined to an examination of the Pay-As-You-Earn system as in weather it is an efficient and effective method of personal income tax (PIT) collection in NSUKKA local government. It thus excludes any other system of tax revenue through Pay-As-You-Earn system with other tax revenue shall be evaluated only for the purpose of comparison.</p>\r\n<p>1.6 &nbsp; &nbsp; LIMITATION OF THE STUDY</p>\r\n<p>The &nbsp;study was limited by the following constraints:&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>(a) &nbsp; &nbsp;there was shortage of relevant texts journal and documentaries on the &nbsp;subject of Pay-As-You-Earn system.<br>(b) &nbsp; &nbsp;Some of the answer givens an opinions expressed in response to question were subjectively based due to different personal experience.<br>(c) &nbsp; &nbsp;A study of this nature require longer period of time than was actually available to me.<br>(d) &nbsp; &nbsp;There is this general problem that many Nigeria do not like to disclose their earnings.<br>(e) &nbsp; &nbsp;Finance available for this study was inadequate considering its scope and my financial standing as a student.</p>\r\n<p>1.7 DEFINITION OF TERMS</p>\r\n<p>(I) &nbsp; &nbsp;BASIS PERIOD: the period in which the income of a taxpayer is assessed for the purposes.<br>(II) &nbsp; &nbsp;ASSESSABLE INCOME: income of a taxpayer from all sources in a given basis period less all allowable deductions and nontaxable income.<br>(III) &nbsp; &nbsp;PRECEEDING YEAR BASIS: A basis period by which income of a tax payer in the year proceeding the year of assessment is assessed.<br>(IV) &nbsp; &nbsp;ACTUAL YEAR BASIS: a basis period by which income of a tax payer in the proceeding the year of assessment is assead in that year.<br>(V) &nbsp; &nbsp;YEAR OF ASSESSMENT: the government financial year in which the income of a taxpayer is assessed for tax purpose.<br>(VI) &nbsp; &nbsp;CHARGEABLE INCOME: assessable income less all reliefs.<br>(VII) &nbsp; &nbsp;RELIEFS: deductible allowance granted to a taxpayer by the law in a relevant year of assessment.<br>(VIII) &nbsp; &nbsp;TAX EVASION: an illegal act of paying less tax than ought to pay.<br>(IX) &nbsp; &nbsp;TAX AVOIDANCE: a legal act by a tax payers to pay less than he ought to pay.<br>(X) &nbsp; &nbsp;TAAX SRETURNS: relevant data supplies by a tax payer for the purpose of assessing income.<br>(XI) &nbsp; &nbsp;TAX DEDUCTION CARD : a document used in the Pay-As-You-Earn scheme in which total allowed relief&rsquo;s are stated.<br>(XII) &nbsp; &nbsp;TAX EMERGENCY CARD: the card temporarily used before the tax deduction card are made available to the employer by internal revenue division.</p>', '<p>The purpose of this research work is to describe the practical approach to an appraisal of pay-as-you-earn system of taxation with referee to Nssuka local government area.

(A CASE STUDY OF EMENTTE LTD) ', '<div>CHAPTER ONE</div>\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n<div>1.0 INTRODUCTION&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n<div>1.1 BACKGROUND OF THE STUDY&nbsp;</div>\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n<div>This project is one that studies the effect of finical accounting reporting&nbsp; of the management of a business. Financial accounting covers those activities that relates to the preparation ofcertain reports which are known as financial statement. These statement report the financial status of a firm at a particular time.&nbsp;</div>\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n<div>The practice of accounting stated since organized life evolved. The early man lived in caves from where he developed into living in communities. Later arose the concept of&nbsp; specialization. That is each person&nbsp; went&nbsp; about doing those&nbsp; &nbsp;activities&nbsp; of life for which he was most&nbsp; gifted. This gave rise to individuals producing certain goods in quantities in excess of what they needed while there were other goods which they need but they did not produce them selves the result was exchange. the first system of exchange was by barter. Later money evolved and replaced barter.&nbsp;</div>\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n<div>During the stage of barter&nbsp; &nbsp;recording were done but only the quantities of good exchanged&nbsp; &nbsp;were recorded. For example in things fall apart,&nbsp; used white marks drawn on the&nbsp; walls as record of his indebtedness to others. However as soon as money&nbsp; evolved all recording were done&nbsp; in&nbsp; montary terms.&nbsp; Another perspective worthy of note about the history of accounting is the impact of the different stage of organized business on accounting. At the stage of specialized in using their skills in creaft and developed the quid system. Here the job was done by one man at most with the aid of members of his family.&nbsp;</div>\r\n<div>The guilds system grew and outsiders were employed to work for the owner.&nbsp;</div>\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n<div>The industrial revolution expanded thee output and gave rise to the factory system of working. As the size of these factories grew it became impossible for one person to set up a factory alone. This gave rise to partnership and of course the joint stock companies. The joint stock act of 1844 is a very important landmark in&nbsp; the evolution of accounting. It marked the evolution of accounting. It marked the beginning of auditing.&nbsp;</div>\r\n<div>The result of this act is what is known to day as limited liability or public limited liability companies.&nbsp;</div>\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n<div>The essential feature of the limited liability companies is that ownership is separate from management. Large numbers of owner (shareholder) across the globe invest in companies while a few directors are elected to mange these companies.&nbsp;</div>\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n<div>This partiarlar development gave impetus to the evolution of auditing as an aspect of accounting. Also the size of these companies and the stiff&nbsp; competition for funds, markets, new ideas and products gave rise to more rigorous accounting techniques like cost and management accounting to aid management in decision making.&nbsp;</div>\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n<div>Taxation is another branch of accounting&nbsp; required to&nbsp; and management in decision&nbsp; making. Tax has a lot of implication for management decision on one hand and is an important source of revenue on the other.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n<div>Even in the public sector it has been observed that accounting is indispensable as a result government public sector accounting has now evolved to take care of this information need.&nbsp;</div>\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n<div>One can not do a comprehensive review of the history or evolution of accounting with has&nbsp; that have been in use. They are the change and discharge system, and the double entry system.&nbsp;</div>\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n<div>In the charge and discharge system, the change is made up of the balance held at the beginning of a period to which is added any receipts from the owner discharge is the on flays made to or on behalf of the owner. It has been cleaned that the double entry system evolved in the&nbsp; 14th century.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n<div>However, it was in the book written by a monk, Luca Pacioli in 1494 titled summa de arithmetic geometric, proportion et proportion that the double entry system was first documented.&nbsp;</div>\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n<div>1.2 STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM</div>\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n<div>An effective information system is&nbsp; very important for the functioning of any business. The financial accounting system in most business do not portray fully the principles of accounting systems.&nbsp;</div>\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n<div>Financial accounting&nbsp; information involves technicalities such as quantitative analysis adequate recording reporting etc. Some business organization may unknowingly employ incompetent and unskilled manpower and as such the financial accounting information&nbsp; prepared may not show a true and fair&nbsp; view of the financial strength profitability and future prospects of the organization.&nbsp;</div>\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n<div>Some organization have to realism that accounting information is the only medium through which both the management and external users get a clear picture of an organization. If they fail to realizes appreciate an accountants analysis inrespect of the accounting information&nbsp; generated, this&nbsp; often leads to poor management decision which will have negative effects on the performance of business organization.&nbsp;</div>\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n<div>1. 3 OBJECTIVE OF THE STUDY&nbsp;</div>\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n<div>The main objective of this study is to determine the effect of financial accounting reporting on the management of a business. Apart from this major aim the study will also find out the following:</div>\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n<div>1.

(67, 'PH023238', 'PROBLEMS AND PROSPECTS OF LOCAL GOVERNMENT FINANCE ACCOUNTING IN NIGERIA (A CASE STUDY OF NSUKKA LOCAL GOVERNMENT AREA)', '<p>CHAPTER ONE</p>\r\n<p>1.1 AN OVERVIEW</p>\r\n<p>In Nigeria, there are three tiers of public sector administration &ndash; the Central (Federal) government, State government; and Local governments. &nbsp;This project is devoted to the examination of the local government&rsquo;s accounts, and the development of financial management with their departments. &nbsp;It is therefore pertinent at this point to mention that the local government is the third tier of government in Nigeria.</p>\r\n<p>Local government in Nigeria derives their existence from the constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria (promulgation) Decree No. 12 of 1989 and the civil service (re-organisation) Decree No. 43 of 1989 as brought about a new awakening to make the public sector virile dynamic, result and development oriented. &nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>At present with the creation of more 177 local governments, the total number of local governments in Nigeria has therefore increased to 774. One would then guess what effects will it have. &nbsp;Even before that, like since 1979, there has been a significant rise in local government expenditure in line with greater emphasis on grassroots participation. &nbsp;For instance, in 1992 while complete political administrative and financial independence was granted to the local government. &nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>From State control, its responsibility was enlarged with effect from 1992, local government has been directly responsible for primary health care. &nbsp;This is in addition to its statutory functions.</p>\r\n<p>Johnson (1992) said that, though virtually all developed countries have a system of local government, some systems involve considerable local autonomy while others involve less. &nbsp;On a spectrum, the Nigeria systems probably involve less, rather than more autonomy. &nbsp;Then the question and answers are important as they reflect that type of financial and accounting framework required.</p>\r\n<p>Sharpe (1980) noted that the participatory value if not the liberty value, still remains as a valid one for modern local government. &nbsp;Not perhaps in the full glory of its early promoters, but as an important element in a modern democracy nonetheless. &nbsp;But as a co-ordinator of services in the field, as a reconciles of community opinion, as a consumer assure group as an agent for responding to rising demand and finally as a counterweight to incept syndicalism, local government seems to have come into its own.</p>\r\n<p>The following points were listed in the local government&rsquo;s favour by the Layfield Committee (2005).</p>\r\n<p>(a) It provides democracy<br>(b) It acts as a counterweight to the uniformity inherent in government decision. &nbsp;It spreads political power.<br>(c) It embraces accountability because it brings those responsible for decision close to their electors.<br>(d) It is efficient because services can be adjusted to local needs and preferences and because responsibility can be more decentralized.<br>(e) Central government would be overloaded by more functions;<br>(f) It provides a vehicle for formulating new policies and pioneering ideas.</p>\r\n<p>As a result of increase in the responsibilities and the fantastic expenditure associated with them, it is vital that the local governments extend their sources of revenue beyond the present level. &nbsp;They would endeavour to tap all the potential resources so as to see their revenue base fortified. &nbsp;Any improvement to this effect will be welcomed as it would give the local government an added impetus in discharging its statutory functions and socio-economic advancement to the local inhabitants.</p>\r\n<p>From the inception of local governments, they have been relying substantially on grants from State and Central governments and also statutory allocation from the federation account in addition to a percentage of the internally generated funds of the State.</p>\r\n<p>As a matter of fact, the internally generated revenue by the local governments was very abysmal. &nbsp;Now that it has been granted autonomy, it is statutorily required to rely more on internally generated funds for the performance of its functions. &nbsp;This being the case, government grants and statutory allocation are only supplementary sources of revenue to the local government. &nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Babangida (1992) for the local government to self-sustaining financially without reducing the level and quality of its services to the people. &nbsp;It is essential that it exploits all potential internal revenue sources which would supplement existing ones. &nbsp;This as well suggests that the existing ones be adequately exploited and properly managed.</p>\r\n<p>1.2 STATEMENT OF PROBLEM: Finance and Accounting in local governments is probably more complex, than in any other part of the public sector. &nbsp;In Nigeria, the inability of local governments to raise adequate funds and keep accurate accounts to sponsor its expenditure and activate grassroots development has been discovered as one of the major predicaments thwarting the frantic efforts of the local governments. &nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>The purpose of this study, therefore, is to assess the problems of finance and accounting in local government so as to determine their prospects.</p>\r\n<p>1.3 HYPOTHESIS: Since this research work is on the problems and prospects of local government finance and accounting in Nigeria&rdquo; the writer obtained facts chiefly through interviews and questionnaires. &nbsp;Some hypotheses have been formulated to enhance better results.</p>\r\n<p>HYPOTHESIS I:</p>\r\n<p>Ho: That an increase in federal government statutory allocation of federation account from 20% - 25% would not help local government in achieving at least 75% of their statutory responsibilities.</p>\r\n<p>HI: That an increase in federal government statutory allocation of federation account from 20% - 25% help local government in achieving at least 75% of their statutory responsibilities.</p>\r\n<p>HYPOTHESIS 2:</p>\r\n<p>Ho: That the employment of low caliber staff has no significant negative relationship with the low efficiency and productivity of the local governments.<br>H1: That the employment of low caliber staff has significant negative relationship with the low efficiency and productivity of the local governments.</p>\r\n<p>HYPOTHESIS 3:</p>\r\n<p>Ho: That the Accounting system of local government is not effective in operation.<br>H1: That the Accounting system of local government is effective in operation.</p>\r\n<p>HYPOTHESIS 4:</p>\r\n<p>Ho: That another source of tax revenue is not essential for Nigerian Local Governments.<br>H1: That another source of tax revenue is essential for Nigerian Local Governments.</p>\r\n<p>OBJECTIVE OF STUDY: Local governments like any other organization encounter financial and of course accounting problems. &nbsp;These problems here in no small measure contributed to their poor performances. &nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>It is therefore, imperative to mention that one of the major reasons for undertaking this work is the belief that for any meaningful improvement to take place in Government Accounting and finance control, the strands forming part of these systems must first be put together in doing so, the inadequacies inherent in the areas of each system would be pointed out and criticized or mentioned as probable areas for future development.</p>\r\n<p>In carrying out the study, efforts should gear to:</p>\r\n<p>1. Identify the major causes of these maladies in the financial system of the local government.<br>2. Examine the accounting department to find out if it is being manned by the desired competent and of course qualified personnel;<br>3. Examine whether the sources of income to the local governments is enough as to enable it discharge its constitutional, statutory and/or otherwise obligations with ease.<br>4. Examine the various instruments of management and control of the local government finances.<br>5. Examine the various problems of the local government&rsquo;s finances and accounts, and ascertain the financial autonomy of the local governments.<br>6. Examine the prospects of improving sources of the local government finances.</p>\r\n<p>1.5 SIGNIFICANCE OF STUDY: Our local governments have in these recent times been riddled with financial and accounting problems. &nbsp;These undoubtedly have stultified the unflinching efforts of most local governments to instill and of course restore sanity in the system, hence the need for a study on the problems and prospects of contemporary local government finance and accounting in Nigeria.</p>\r\n<p>The study leaves no stone unturned in examining the problems confronting the existing revenue sources of the local governments and appraises talent revenue resources which could be used to fortify the overall revenue base of the local governments. &nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>This study therefore points out significantly that improved local government finance and accounting system in the cornerstone to the much desired economic growth and development. &nbsp;It potentially serves as a guide to policy making in designing a better strategy for the rural development in Nigeria. &nbsp;The study also forms a source of reference in other related topics and to researchers in similar topics.</p>\r\n<p>1.6 LIMITATIONS OF STUDY: As has been earlier mentioned, finance and accounting in local governments is fraught with complexities. &nbsp;It is then not possible to provide a fully comprehensive coverage of all facts of the subject in this kind of study, local government finance and accounting has developed in a distinctive fashion and as such has evolved a terminology that may be unfamiliar even to those with experiences of finance and accounting in either the public or private sector.</p>\r\n<p>This study restricts itself to the evaluation of the various revenue sources and expenditure patterns of the local governments, examination of the problems associated with them and the prospects for enhancing them. &nbsp;Since it is not possible for a research project of this kind to delve into a study of the entire local governments in Nigeria individually, this research work is confined to information gathered from Nsukka Local Government.</p>\r\n<p>The student researcher of this work is of desired intention to carry out an elaborate and comprehensive study of the problems and prospects of the local government in Nigeria, but has to obey impenetrate limitations encountered during the research. &nbsp;At the local government under study necessary statistical data could not be obtained in a particular location and bureaucratic tendencies seemed to be a rule rather than an exception.</p>\r\n<p>Moreso, majority of the local government staffers are illiterate people and could not give written information without assistance from enlightened fellows. &nbsp;Yet some respondents are reluctant to comply with piece of information needed from them.</p>\r\n<p>In the final analysis, this research work was also limited to the data gathered from the finance and accounting department of the local government. &nbsp;As such, it should be interested to note that treasury department was the major source of information used in analyzing the study.</p>\r\n<p>1.7DEFINITION OF TERMS:</p>\r\n<p>LOCAL GOVERNMENT: Local government is the third tier of government. &nbsp;According to Shehu (1976), it is that level of government which is organized as close as possible to the people at the grassroots and vested with statutory powers to perform certain functions both inherent and ascribed confining its activities and authority within particular district or neighbourhood and subject to the control of the central government.</p>\r\n<p>FINANCE: Finance refers to the raising of funds, controlling and using them in the running of an organization, be it private, corporation or government (Ume, 1980).</p>\r\n<p>ACCOUNTING: Accounting is defined by Douglas (1976) as &ldquo;a discipline concerned with the recording, analysis, and forecasting of income and wealth of business and other entities.</p>\r\n<p>FUNDS: The National committee on Government Accounting (USA) defined a fund as &ldquo;an independent fiscal and accounting entity with a self-balancing set of accounts recording cash and/or other resources together with all related liabilities, obligations, reserves and equities which are segregated for the purpose of carrying on specific activities or attaining certain objectives in accordance with special regulations, restrictions or limitations&rdquo;.</p>\r\n<p>REVENUE: Revenue refers to all those monies, each and otherwise received by way of statutory allocation, grants, subvention from higher levels of government, taxes, rates, licenses, fees, royalties, loans and charges which enable the government to meet its day to day expenses and its capital expenditure programmes.</p>\r\n<p>EXPENDITURE: Expenditure refers to all those activities/services performed/rendered by the government with available resources (Egonwa, 1985).</p>\r\n<p>CAPITAL EXPENDITURE: This consists of expenditure the benefit of which is not fully consumed in one period, but spread over several periods. &nbsp;It includes assets acquired for the purpose of earning income, or increasing the earning capacity of the business. &nbsp;For example, land and buildings, plant and machinery, maintaining of roads and other projects of capital nature.<br>&nbsp;<br>BUDGET: A budget is a plan expressed in quantitative and usually monetary terms, covering a specified period of time usually a year.</p>\r\n<p>ESTIMATE: An estimate is a proposed budget which is yet to be approved. &nbsp;It is a statement of planned revenue and expenditure of the government for the coming year. &nbsp;This like budget is normally expressed in monetary units.</p>\r\n<p>REVENUE ESTIMATE: As the name implies, it is the part of the estimate in which is stated the expected revenue from overall sources of the government for the coming fiscal year.</p>\r\n<p>RECURRENT EXPENDITURE ESTIMATE: This is an aspect of the estimate that stipulates in detailed shape, expected recurrent expenditure of the government of the following fiscal year.</p>\r\n<p>CAPITAL EXPENDITURE ESTIMATE: This specifies the expected capital expenditure project of the government for the coming fiscal year.<br>&nbsp;<br>REVENUE ABSTRACT: This is a record which shows at a glance in a concise meaner all revenue receipts heed by all, and subhead by subhead that accrues to the local government in a given financial year.</p>\r\n<p>EXPENDITURE ABSTRACT: This is a summary of all expenditures incurred by the local government categorized according to vote heads during a particular fiscal year.</p>\r\n<p>STATUTORY FUNCTIONS: These are functions that the local government is legally binding to carry out. &nbsp;An edge outside it may amount to an ultra vires and will therefore be rendered null and void and of no effect.</p>\r\n<p>INTERNAL REVENUE: This is the aspect of revenue that the local government can generate within its area of jurisdiction.</p>', '<p>The title of this research work is, problems and prospects of local government finance/accounting in Nigeria&rdquo; with particular reference to Nsukka Local Government Area, Enugu State. &nbsp;It has been identified that accounting and financial reporting in the public sector particularly at the local government level was not given adequate attention.</p>\r\n<p>In the course of carrying out this study, the following objectives among others were set which included. &nbsp;The identification of major causes of maladies in the financial system of the local government; to examine the accounting department, to find out if it is manned by competent and qualified personnel, to examine whether the sources of income to the local government finances, to examine the various problems of the local government finances and accounts and to examine the prospects of improving the available sources of the local government finances.</p>\r\n<p>To achieve the set objectives, some hypotheses were formulated which comprised: an increase in local government share of federation account from 20-25% would help local governments in achieving at least 75% of their statutory responsibilities, the employment of low caliber staff has a significant negative relationship with the low efficiency and productivity of local governments, the Accounting system of local government is not effective in operation and that another source of tax revenue is not essential for Nigerian Local Governments.</p>\r\n<p>Two broad research methods were adopted in this study which were personal interviews and fully designed and well-structured questionnaires. &nbsp;For the purposes of analyzing the hypotheses, chi-square (x2) technique was adopted.</p>\r\n<p>As a result of conscientious and of course painstaking study done, a lot of findings were made which included inter-alia, there was an ample proof that the greater number of local government&rsquo;s employees are unqualified.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Other taxes to be collected by the local governments can improve its financial base, the employment of low caliber staff has no significant negative relationship with the low efficiency and productivity of the local government; and increase, from 20 &ndash; 25% in the Federal Government Statutory Allocation of federation account would not be enough to defray a reasonable proportion of such responsibilities, embezzlement, receipt of huge kick-backs, contract inflations, large scale salary, fraud, auditing and internal control problems were discovered as some of the major accounting and financial problems of the local governments.</p>\r\n<p>As a result, the following recommendations were proffered: &nbsp;efforts to be intensified in the collection of revenue and continuously seek new avenues for local taxations, emphasis to be placed on the recruitment of qualified, experienced and well-trained personnel for the assessment, collection and general administration of local taxes and rates, design a sound system of budgetary control, installation of a system of internal control, projects to be evaluated and implemented, proper feasibility study to be carried out; and internal funding to be improved by its engagement in commercial ventures.</p>',

It also wished to stand market failures, engender regional development, enhance job creation capacities as well as social services delivery.</p>\r\n<p>Unfortunately, as years progressed the objective of government in establishing these public enterprises where to come to nothing as the enterprises were riddle with corruption, mismanagement, over-dependences on the treasury for funding, poor service accountant by the arrogance and arrogance and insensitivity of the managers of these enterprises as well as inequities brought about by nepotism (El-Rafai, 2000). &nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>These public enterprises began to perform below the expectation of the reason for its establishment, such enterprises as Nigeria Air Ways Nigeria Railway Corporation (NRC), Nigeria Coal Corporation (NCC) the National Electric Power Authority (NEPA), gradually witnessed, obsolete facilities, corruption, mismanagement, resulting in poor service delivery huge debt of salaries and wages pension and so on.</p>\r\n<p>In an effort to put state enterprises back to its former glory, government committed billions of naira to rehabilitate them which resulted in fruitless effort was most of them today has collapsed. As a result of government huge financial investment in these arriving industries, it has failed in fulfilling it primary objectives, which is the provision of infrastructure and security through the maintenances of law and orders as well as promotion of enabling and conducive economic environment.</p>\r\n<p>Against this back background, it became a national policy imperative to disengage government from wasteful investment by taking public sector away from these areas where the private sector has the comparative advantage to perform, while letting the state concern to thrive through enhanced wealth creation. &nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>To achieve these purpose the federal government started a process of privatization and commercialization since 1988. The programme would ensure the inflow of investment, management and technology that would improve and grow the nation is infrastructure services and industries for the benefit of the people.</p>\r\n<p>Privatization involves transfer of ownership of enterprises between the government and the private sector. This implies that the predominant share in ownership of assures on transfer lies with private shareholders. &nbsp;Mostly, developed countries of the world, such as Britain, United State of American (U.S.A) with sound economic base has their economic growth hinged on private sector through privatization. &nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Britain has about 90% of their economy in the private sector. &nbsp;The same is USA which is believed to have the world most privatized economy. &nbsp;Therefore, for Nigeria to integrate its economy into the main stream of world economic order, it must embark on privatization.</p>\r\n<p>Dues to the misconceptions, conflicts and debates generated by privatization in Nigeria, to writer was moved to embark on this project entitled.</p>\r\n<p>Privatization &ndash; as a means of sowing Nigeria Economic problems (with NEPA as a case study) this is with a view to highlighting its need for our economic growth.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>1.1 PROBLEMS OF THE STUDY</p>\r\n<p>In Nigeria public sector has been riddle with corruption, mismanagement, inefficiency, poor service delivery, lack of up to date technology, indolent staff, lack of maintenance. &nbsp;The National Electric Power Authority (NEPA) as one of the public enterprise has been bedeviled with these shortcomings. &nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>The Epileptic power supply, manor and resources wasted by the electric users as a result of lack of power supply has been a source of worry to enable citizen of the matter.</p>\r\n<p>How could power supply be improved? &nbsp;What would eliminate corruption on the part of NEPA personnel&rsquo;s? &nbsp;How could the over dependent of this sector treasury be eliminated? &nbsp;What would ensure completion efficiency, improved service delivery and up to date equipment? &nbsp;How could regular power supply be ensured? &nbsp;What would bring to an end?</p>\r\n<p>1.2 OBJECTIVES OF THE STUDY</p>\r\n<p>The objective of this study include.</p>\r\n<p>1.To find out why public enterprises has failed in performance when compared to private enterprise.<br>2. To correct the misconceptions on privatization of public enterpriser.<br>3. To re-orientate the kinds of the people on how privatization could reduce, corruption, mismanagement, inefficiency and improve technology.<br>4. To identify hindrances to privatization.<br>5. To highlight the advantages of privatization to Nigeria economy.<br>6. To recommend how a successful handing over of public enterprises to private sector could be achieved.<br>7. To present a platform for researchers and knowledge seekers on privatization.</p>\r\n<p>1.3 SIGNIFICANT OF THE STUDY</p>\r\n<p>This study is very important now the government is seriously committed to the privatization programmed. &nbsp;By this study, people would see reason to give their support to the privatization process, moreso, by having a successful privatization of major public enterprises such National Electric Power Authority (NEPA). &nbsp;It would broaden Nigeria capital market and created large body of shareholders. &nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>In the process of privatization, more investible capital will be injected into the various economics through local and foreign investors to the benefit of the country at large. &nbsp;Also, funds that would have been committed to maintenance of otherwise inefficient enterprises have been freed into more productive sectors of the economy.</p>\r\n<p>1.4 STATEMENT OF HYPOTHESIS</p>\r\n<p>The following are the hypothesis of the study</p>\r\n<p>HYPOTHESIS 1</p>\r\n<p>H0: Privatization is not a genuine and programmatic approach to revitalization of Nigeria economy.&nbsp;<br>H1: Privatization is a genuine and programmatic approach to revitalization of Nigeria economy.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>HYPOTHESIS 2</p>\r\n<p>H0: Privatization has not lead to the financial independence of a company.<br>H1: Privatization has lead to the financial independence of a company.</p>\r\n<p>HYPOTHESIS 3</p>\r\n<p>H0: Privatization of NEPA has not improved productivity, efficiency, management and adequate utilization of the resources of the organization.<br>H1: Privatization of NEPA has improved productivity, efficiency, management and adequate utilization of the resources of the organization.</p>\r\n<p>1.5 SCOPE OF THE STUDY</p>\r\n<p>The scope of the study is to examine the general principles of privatization and how it could help to improve Nigerian economy. &nbsp;It does not cover the technical implantation of privatization programme. &nbsp;The area of coverage is NEPA Enugu District.</p>\r\n<p>1.6 LIMITATION OF THE STUDY</p>\r\n<p>In the course of the study, the researcher encounters some difficulties, which constitute some limitations to the study. &nbsp;These includes:</p>\r\n<p>i. Time: Due to short period needed to complete the project from the time of its approval, the researcher could not do a through work as intended.<br>ii. Finance: The money required by the researcher for transportation to various place required, gathering of literal material and for type setting and well as binding in short supply.</p>\r\n<p>Data collection/literal materials. &nbsp;Reference materials needy for the study was not easy to come by as most of the document were mostly classified document. &nbsp;<br>Some of the respondents were not willing to co-operate with the researcher during the time of data collection. &nbsp;It was not easy to interview the district manager and the chief accounts of NEPA Enugu District.</p>\r\n<p>Nevertheless, despite the above limitations, the researcher tried to lift her head above the obstacles and did a good work within the time and resources available to her.</p>\r\n<p>1.7 DEFINITION OF TERMS</p>\r\n<p>Some definition of terms as used in the study were as below.</p>\r\n<p>a.

(69, 'PH453649', 'THE IMPACT OF SOCIAL MEDIA ON CONSUMER BUYING BEHAVIOUR OF TOYOTA BRAND OF VEHICLES', '<p>CHAPTER ONE</p>\r\n<p>1.1 Introduction<br>1.2 Background of the Study&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>In recent years the online environment is viewed by users from a new perspective, in a commercial way. Its development and the emergence of online stores have turned users into consumers. Also, the most important role of social media has changed the way consumers and marketers communicate. (Hennig-Thurau T., Gwinner K., Walsh G. &amp; Gremler D., 2004). Informational society influences the consumer buying decision and product evaluations. Social media provides a new channel to acquire product information through peer communication, (Kozinets, 1999).&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>However, with the aid of information and modern communication technologies, consumers are able to shop via Internet using several Social Media and different websites (Toomey and Wysocki, 2005). This type of shopping mode can come in several names such as online shopping, online buying behavior and Internet shopping. All names of shopping mode refer to the process of purchasing and buying products or services via the Internet using several Social Media and different websites (Li and Zhang, 2002).&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Social Media (SM) are web-based services which are also known as \"Social Networking Sites\". Social Media refer to network of relationships and interactions among different users (groups or individuals) (Kempe &amp; Chin, 2003). Social Media such as Facebook, Instagram and Twitter enable users to maintain great connections among themselves as well as others (Ellison &amp; Kozinets, 2007) by achieving more than one task and facilitating the way of communicating and sharing different information (comments, thoughts, videos and images) (Kietzmann, 2011).&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Social Media is playing significant roles in different aspects of our lives. What is interesting in SM is that it supports users in several sectors, such as, business, marketing, advertising and education (Hennig-Thurau et al., 2010). From business perspective, businesses and buyers can interact directly by SM with each other, and thereby find whatever products and services they are looking for (Parson, 2013).&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Consumers today are progressively utilizing technology and particularly Social Media as an effective tool in their online shopping process. This process can be defined as is an electronic process that allows consumers to deal with business people and meet their purchases\' needs.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Pookulangara and Koesler (2011) in their study of social media marketing indicated that SM enable 25% of all consumers to post links about products and services information in their retail sites to update other users about the purchase process. Another study of Miller (2010) stated in his research of online marketing, that social marketing has made very important role in persuading consumers to buy online. He found that 70% of consumers are visiting Social Media to get useful information, 49% of them made the decision to buy certain product and 60% of consumers prefer to share their information about the products with others online.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>However, the actual transactions of purchasing processes occur for only 7% of consumers (Miller and Lammas, 2010). Online shopping is growing everywhere and different categories of consumers are influenced by this phenomenon. For instance, the percentage of online buyers is increasing in India, China, Japan and Australia for about 87%, 85% (North Asia and Europe), 83% (North America), 81% (South and Latin America) and 53% (Africa and Pakistan) (Solorzano, 2011).&nbsp;<br>The overall online purchasing process has enabled 875 million consumers to boost the percentage of other online shoppers to 40% in the recent two years due to the recommendations posted in different SM about products.</p>\r\n<p>1.3 Statement of Problem&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>The introduction of the Internet has changed the way organizations promote their products and services and products as well as the channels of communication between them and their customers. This is seen in the way they market and communicate their brands and products, which has become a challenging project.</p>\r\n<p>Customers are overwhelmed by marketing commercials and promotional events. The sensitivity of customers to get excited is fading out on promotional events and consumers are beginning to resist the effect of some companies at marketing them.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Basically, the promotional focus of some organizations is on the conventional mass media advert style, which includes commercial TV, radio jingles and advertisements in print formats such as newspapers and magazines along with billboard placements. It is now on record that as the Internet is fast advancing across the global marketplace, the effectiveness of traditional mass media is fast on the decline.</p>\r\n<p>It is on this background that this study needs to be carried out in order to determine the rate at which social media can contribute to the sales of Toyota Brand of vehicles.</p>\r\n<p>1.4 Research Questions:&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>1. How do consumers perceive online buying of Toyota brand of vehicle?<br>2. What are the factors that motivate consumers to buy Toyota vehicles through social media?&nbsp;<br>3. What are the changes social media has brought to consumers of Toyota Brand of vehicles in different stages of their decision making?</p>\r\n<p>1.5 Objectives of the Study</p>\r\n<p>The research aims to determine the impact of social media on consumer buying behavior to Toyota brand of vehicle. The study specifically, determine to:</p>\r\n<p>1. Examine consumers&rsquo; perception towards buying of Toyota brand of vehicle online.<br>2. Examine the factors that motivate consumers to buy Toyota brand of vehicle through social media.<br>3. Examine how much social media has affected consumers&rsquo; buying Behavior of Toyota brand of vehicle.</p>\r\n<p>1.6 Statement of Hypotheses:</p>\r\n<p>The hypotheses could simply state below to help us accept or reject our finding.<br>&nbsp;<br>1. &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>H0: Customers have negative perception towards online shopping of Toyota brand of vehicle.&nbsp;<br>H1: Customers have positive perception towards online shopping of Toyota brand of vehicle.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>2 &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>H0: There is no significant relationship between social media and buying behavior of consumers<br>H1: There is a significant relationship between social media and buying behavior of consumers</p>\r\n<p>3 &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>H0: Social media has not significantly influenced the different stages of consumer decision making on the purchase of Toyota Brand of vehicles<br>H1: Social media has not significantly influenced the different stages of consumer decision making on the purchase of Toyota Brand of vehicles</p>\r\n<p>1.7 Significance of the Study&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>It has been suggested by the researchers that the consumers look for information assisting them in deciding the relative significance of the several appraising criteria, and might further seek concepts regarding the degree to which they alternate features that they consider significant.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Online consumers in the past were confined to sharing information with their neighbors, family or friends; however, now people are able to impact the international community by articulating their personal experiences on the Internet.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>In accordance with the relevant researches, the external resources may be either online or offline (Breiger, 2004). Many sources of external search include; interpersonal search and media search. Interpersonals are powered by social software and Web 2.0 tools that support social behavior to create and recreate social conventions and social contexts. The Internet allows consumers to interact, compare experiences, and exchange ideas with other consumers.</p>\r\n<p>1.8 Scope and Limitation of the Research&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>The scope of this study will focus on the impact of social media platform on consumer buying behavior with particular reference to Toyota brand of vehicles in Akwa Ibom State.</p>\r\n<p>1.9 Limitation of the Study</p>\r\n<p>This study is limited by some factors that are likely to be encountered during the course of carrying out the research. These are:</p>\r\n<p>1. Time Constraints: The short duration for the project research and the interference of other academic work will affect the timely conclusion of the work.</p>\r\n<p>2. Financial Constraint: Being a student, the researcher has little means of earning and so finance needed to travel to places to acquire data for the research work will be difficult to get, however, the researcher intends to try her possible best to acquire the finances needed for the project to be carried out.</p>\r\n<p>1.10 Definition of Terms</p>\r\n<p>Consumer Buying Behavior: This refers to the multi-step decision-making process people engage in and the actions they take to satisfy their needs and wants in the marketplace (Kotler, 2008).</p>\r\n<p>Consumer Behaviour: Schiffinan and Kanuk (2004) define Consumer Behaviour as the behaviour that customers display in searching for, purchasing, using, evaluating and disposing of products and services that they expect will satisfy their needs.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Consumer buying behaviour incorporates the acts of individuals directly involved in obtaining, using and disposing of economic goods and services including the decision process that precede and determine these acts (Huctings 1995).</p>\r\n<p>Consumer Decision Making: Mahatoo (1985) defines Consumer Behavior decision making process as consisting of a number of steps that begin before the purchase and reaches beyond the buying act. He suggests that marketers have to go beyond the various influences on buyers and develop an understanding of how consumers actually make their buying decisions.</p>\r\n<p>Economic Factors: Economic Factor is the set of fundamental information that affects a business or an investment\'s value and a buyer&rsquo;s spending behaviour. &nbsp;According to Brassington (2011), economic factors include among others; the level of income, credit availability, attitude towards spending, liquid assets.</p>\r\n<p>Socio Cultural Factors: Social cultural factors include a number of factors that characterize the relationships and activities of a group of people within a particular set environment (Jones, 2007).</p>', '<p>The research work; the impact of social media on consumer buying behaviour of Toyota brand of vehicles aim at finding out whether Customers have positive perception towards online shopping of Toyota brand of vehicle and also to find out whether Social media has significantly influenced the different stages of consumer decision making on the purchase of Toyota Brand of vehicles.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Some of the concepts of social media was discussed in chapter two of the research work and a method of chi-square was applied for the method of analysis with a sample size of 200 respondents. From the result of the analysis, we found that the responses of the respondents concerning the effect of social media on consumer buying behaviour of TOYOTA brand of vehicles were all positive with high percentages except for perception towards online shopping.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>The p value for the analysis for the other hypothesis were found to be (0.000) less than the level of significance, so we concluded that social media has significantly influenced the different stages of customer decision making on the purchases of Toyota brand of vehicles and also that there is a significant relationship between social media and consumer buying behavior of Toyota brand of products.</p>', '<p>TABLE OF CONTENT</p>\r\n<p>DECLARATION<br>APPROVAL PAGE<br>CERTIFICATION<br>DEDICATION &nbsp;<br>ACKNOWLEDGEMENT &nbsp;<br>ABSTRACT</p>\r\n<p>CHAPTER ONE</p>\r\n<p>1.1 Introduction<br>1.2 Background of the Study&nbsp;<br>1.3 Statement of Problem&nbsp;<br>1.4 Research Questions:&nbsp;<br>1.5 Objectives of the Study<br>1.6 Statement of Hypotheses:<br>1.7 Significance of the Study&nbsp;<br>1.8 Scope and Limitation of the Research&nbsp;<br>1.9 Limitation of the Study<br>1.10 Definition of Terms</p>\r\n<p>CHAPTER TWO</p>\r\n<p>LITERATURE REVIEW</p>\r\n<p>2.1 Conceptual Framework<br>2.1.0 Economic Factors Affecting Consumer Purchasing Decisions<br>2.1.1 Consumer Decision Process&nbsp;<br>2.1.2 Social Media<br>2.1.4 Impact of Social Media E- Marketing<br>2.1.5 Social Media: The New Mindset<br>2.1.6 Social Media and Consumer<br>2.1.7 Corporate Image of Toyota Toward Customers Buying Behaviour<br>2.6 Review of Related Literatures<br>2.7 Theoretical Framework</p>\r\n<p>CHAPTER THREE</p>\r\n<p>RESEARCH METHODOLOGY</p>\r\n<p>3.1 Introduction<br>3.2 Research Design&nbsp;<br>3.3 Population of the Study<br>3.4 Selection of Sample/sample Techniques<br>3.5 Sources of Data&nbsp;<br>3.6 Validity of Instrument<br>3.7 Reliability of Instrument<br>3.8 Techniques of Data Analysis<br>3.9 Decision for Validation of Hypothesis</p>\r\n<p>CHAPTER FOUR</p>\r\n<p>4.1 Data Presentation, Data Analysis and Interpretation<br>4.2 Data Presentation and Analysis<br>4.3 Research Hypothesis</p>\r\n<p>Hypothesis 1<br>Hypothesis 2<br>Hypothesis 3</p>\r\n<p>CHAPTER FIVE</p>\r\n<p>SUMMARY, CONCLUSION AND RECOMMENDATION<br>CONCLUSION<br>RECOMMENDATION<br>References<br>APPENDIX<br>LIST OF TABLES</p>\r\n<p>Table 1 - Gender of the Respondents<br>Table 2 - Ages of the Respondents<br>Table 3 - Marital status of the respondents<br>Table 4 - Educational Qualification of the Respondents<br>Table 5 - Years of Experience of the Respondents<br>Table 6 - Customers have positive perception towards online shopping of Toyota brand of vehicles<br>Table 7 - Social Media Efficiency has Improved Overtime In Nigeria<br>Table 8 -Social media has significantly influenced the different stages of customer decision making on the purchase of toyota brand of vehicles<br>Table 9 - Toyota brand of vehicles seems more reliable than other brand of vehicles<br>Table 10 - Online shopping has significantly influenced the level of interaction among buyers and seller of toyota products<br>Table 11 - The use of social media has significant impact on the social and economic development of Nigeria</p>', '', '5', 'Year 4', '10', '5', 'Yes', 1, 22, 'paid', 5000, 'THE IMPACT OF SOCIAL MEDIA ON CONSUMER BUYING BEHAVIOUR OF TOYOTA BRAND OF VEHICLES', 1, 5, '2025-05-22 11:47:07', '2025-05-22 11:47:07', 'approved', 'the-impact-of-social-media-on-consumer-buying-behaviour-of-toyota-brand-of-vehicles');

The phrase can be induced or possibly eliminated if human beings can foresee or visualize what would happen in future. Life itself is full of risks and uncertainties abound. Every individual faces risks, either of personal nature or business nature.</div>\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n<div>A businessman for instance faces the risk of his goods being damaged by fire while his dependant may suffer loss of income through his death. Equally, a manufacturing firm runs the physical risk of possible loss of goods by fire or theft or such other technical risk as loss of trade as a result of government policies, loss of trade of trade due to change in fashion, loss of profit as a result of fire outbreak.&nbsp;</div>\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n<div>A car owner for instance stands to face the possible theft of his car and damage through accident. Efforts can be made to avoid some of these risks. Accidents can be avoided if proper precautions are taken. An individual can avoid airplane disaster or crash by not engaging in air travel no matter how careful one can be, some form of danger still hangs around.</div>\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n<div>Some risks are inherent in nature or life itself and cannot be avoided. For instance, men are mortal and must die, when complete avoidance is impossible, man attempts to reduce or possibly assumes risks.&nbsp;</div>\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n<div>A thatched roof house is a greater fire risk than one with tiled roof. Many people accept the small risk of building house of standard construction than that of thatched roof. Here the risk has not been avoided but reduced. Risk assumption may also arise out of ignorance or may even be an intentional art where the degree of expose risk is slight or possible loss is minimal.&nbsp;</div>\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n<div>Assumption is even possible where a deliberate provision has been made for consequences of loss happening. Many individuals would however prefer to shift or spread the risk where possible.&nbsp;</div>\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n<div>It is here that Social Economic Services rendered by Insurance companies will be appreciated. Insurance has been described as a social device by which the Insured agrees to transfer all or part of his risks to the Insurer who agrees to indemnify him when the risk insured against happens on the payment of the premium.&nbsp;</div>\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n<div>The basic role of insurance is to create a common pool into which the individual or organization contribute premium commensurate with the degree of risk for which insurance is sought. The members of the pool who are unfortunate to suffer loss are compensated with the contributions of others in the pool.&nbsp;</div>\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n<div>In this way, the larger society is made to be made to be responsible for providing compensation for the unfortunate few who unavoidably incur financial losses through the operation of certain mishap.</div>\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n<div>It is therefore obligatory on the part of the insurer to compensate the insured (their client) whenever, is loss on the item insured against as long as the insured abides to the conditions stated in the contract or policy. Thus, the modern society retain insurance as the method of solving the risk associated with their activities, in that it helps to soften the financial blow that would have resulted. When the public feels that this function is not being carried out the industry may suffer or face a possible collapse.</div>\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n<div>1.1 STATEMENT OF PROBLEM</div>\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n<div>The major reason for the establishment of insurance company is to provide a cushion for individual or organization that has or may suffer some misfortune at a price called premium.&nbsp;</div>\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n<div>Sometimes when loss occurs and claims presented, they are delayed or declined and when paid it does not restore the insured to his former financial position. This has formed the architect of dispute between the insured and the insurer. These I think affect the attitude of insuring public and development of the insurance industry in Nigeria.&nbsp;</div>\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n<div>It is therefore the purpose of the study to find out why claims are delayed or not paid at all and the role played by the insuring public that result in claim being settled or declined. The study also finds out if approach to claim settlement affect attitude of the insuring public and to what extent it affect the development of the insurance industry.</div>\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n<div>1.2 OBJECTIVE/PURPOSE OF&nbsp; STUDY</div>\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n<div>The objective of this research work is to look into the performance of the Nigerian insurance industry viz a viz the procedure and approach to claim settlement. Individuals hold diverse opinion about this industry and the general impression is that the insurance industry has failed to win the confidence of the insuring public.&nbsp;</div>\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n<div>Often times, people make remark such as &ldquo;unwilling to settle claim but always willing to collect premium and use its small prints in the policy to decline its liability&rdquo;. It is the belief about the industry is allowed to continue and not corrected that the industry will totally collapse and the after effect will be over bearing on the economy.&nbsp;</div>\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n<div>When we consider the importance of insurance in the economic development of any nation, it is therefore the intention of the researcher to find out if this allegation is true or otherwise, proffer solution and make recommendation that will help to solve these problems.</div>\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n<div>The purpose of study among other things is to:-</div>\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n<div>- Find out if insurance companies are capitalizing on the ignorance or illiteracy of the insuring public.</div>\r\n<div>- To find out what the perception of the public is towards insurance companies.</div>\r\n<div>- To find out if there are laws that make it impossible for them to settle claim that are genuine.</div>\r\n<div>- To find out what makes it difficult for insurance companies to settle claim when they arise.</div>\r\n<div>- To find out the effect of rate cutting on the insurance companies.</div>\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n<div>1.3RESEARCH QUESTION</div>\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n<div>Having defined the background to the problem and purpose of study, it is therefore expected that practical answers will be provided to the following questions at the end of the study.</div>\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n<div>- Does illiteracy of the public have nay effect on the ability of the insurer to settle claim?</div>\r\n<div>- Does the insuring public involve intermediates in their insurance affair or contract?</div>\r\n<div>- Should emphasis be laid on police report before claim settlement?</div>\r\n<div>- Why is the issue of under settlement common?</div>\r\n<div>- Is there a shift from comprehensive to third party motor?</div>\r\n<div>- How effective is their approach in claim settlement?</div>\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n<div>1.4 SIGNIFICANCE OF STUDY</div>\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n<div>Claim administration is the core of insurance business; an efficient and prompt setting service is the best of advertising for an insurance company.</div>\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n<div>But since claim settlement has been a subject of controversy this study will help :-</div>\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n<div>-The insurer&nbsp; claim. Setting superior value and effective settlement of claim. The insurance company can change their customer expectations and make them the engine fuel of innovation by listening to their careful analysis, complaints compliment and evaluation of their services delivered.</div>\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n<div>-The study will also be relevant to academicians who may wish to know themselves of data and information about&nbsp; claim settlement situation in enugu, it will also enlighten the public at large on insurance matters. More so the study will serve as a dimension to putup researchers&nbsp; and will give them the bases for validating and disapproving the finding of this study.</div>\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n<div>1.5 SCOPE AND LIMITATION OF STUDY&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</div>\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n<div>The scope of this study covers Nigeria but because of time and difficulty in reaching all the insurance companies in Nigeria, the researcher close to cover only the registered insurance companies in Enugu state.</div>\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n<div>LIMITATION:-&nbsp; in carry out a research work researcher is bound to encounter some difficulties which act as limiting factor. The following are the limitation in this study.</div>\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n<div>The cost of carrying out a research work is getting very high especially during this period of harsh economic reality which places a greater burden on the researcher&rsquo;s limited resources.&nbsp;</div>\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n<div>In order to carry out an in-depth study on any subject matter time is absolutely required. The researcher was constrained in carry out in-depth study on major matter due to complete factors affecting the disposal of time.</div>\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n<div>The level of some of the respondents caused some communication problem for researcher and this her to rely on the service of interpreter during interviews.</div>\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n<div>Getting response from commercial vehicle owners was an uphill task. These were inadequate materials hence, the researcher was faced with difficulties, in sourcing relevant material for this study.</div>\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n<div>The researcher has rely on mostly on material from oriental&nbsp; insurance co. The nature of this topic was very general and wide. The researcher has to narrow it down to vehicle insurance claim since it is the most common, compulsory and formed the basis on which conclusion about insurance is drawn.</div>\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n<div>1.6 DEFINITION OF TERMS</div>\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n<div>POLICY:-this is a document which gives the term and condition of insurance contract. It is popularly called insurance policy and it is given&nbsp; to the insured by the insurer after his proposal has been accepted and his premium paid. This shows an evidence existing contract between the insured and the insurer.</div>\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n<div>PREMIUM: - is the monetary consideration passing from the insured to the insurer for their undertaking to pay the sum insured in the event of the risk insured against happening. It is a necessary element in formation of an insurance contract.</div>\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n<div>PROPOSAL FORM: - This is a document drafted by the insurer and which seeks answers to main material aspects of the risk. It is a questioned designed to elicit material information pertaining to the risk to be insured. It is completed by the person who wants to enter into insurance contract.</div>\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n<div>CLAIM FORM: - This is a form in which the insured states the circumstances of the occurrence of the damage or loss for which he sought the form given to him by the insurer.</div>\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n<div>CLAIM: - This is an application by the policy holder to exercise the right to indemnify or benefit under the policy.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n<div>LOSS ADJUSTERS: - This is an independent firm whose services are employed by the insurance company if there is excess claim by the insured to assess such claim. After their assessment, their judgement is final and they are paid for such services by the insurance company.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n<div>NOTICE OF RENEWAL: - A policy meant for one year for instance, 2000-1st January 2001 is expected to lapse at the end of one year. So before it lapses, a renewal is sent to the insured reminding him to come and renew his policy because any claim on lapsed policy is not entertained.</div>\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n<div>ALMOST GOODFAITH: - Due to its fiduciary nature it is required by this doctrine that all parties to an insurance contract should disclose material fact concerning the contract that they want to enter into whether required or not.</div>\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n<div>PROXIMATE CAUSE: - The active efficient cause that sets in motion a chain of events which brings about a result without intervention of any force stated and working actively. From new and independent source in Pawsay V. Scottish union and national (1907).</div>\r\n<div>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</div>\r\n<div>CONTRIBUTION:- is the right of an insurer to call upon others similar but not necessarily equally liable to the same insured to share the cost of an indemnity payment (J.I.Stell, Elements of insurance study course II textbook, London, chapter 5 page 5)</div>\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n<div>SUBROGATION: - Is a contract that beholds indemnity contract. It is to prevent the insured from receiving more than indemnity.</div>\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n<div>INSURABLE INTEREST: -&nbsp; Legal to insure arising out of financial relationship between the insured and subject matter of insurance enforceable at law.</div>\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n<div>INDEMNITY: - Is the control principle of justice. Brett n Castellen V. Preston (1883). Indemnity is a mechanism of pulling the insured back to the former position he enjoyed immediately before the loss.</div>\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n<div>RISK: - Is the chance of loss. Risk is also the uncertainty as to the occurrence of an economic loss.</div>', '<p>The saying &ldquo;HAD I KNOWN&rdquo;, is a frequent question of the human race. The phrase can be induced or possibly eliminated if human beings can foresee or visualize what would happen in future. Life itself is full of risks and uncertainties abound. Every individual faces risks, either of personal nature or business nature.</p>', '<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n<div>TABLE OF CONTENTS</div>\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n<div>Title page</div>\r\n<div>Approval page</div>\r\n<div>Dedication</div>\r\n<div>Acknowledgement</div>\r\n<div>Title page</div>\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n<div>CHAPTER ONE</div>\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n<div>Background of Study</div>\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n<div>1.1 Statement of problem</div>\r\n<div>1.2 Objective/Purpose of Study</div>\r\n<div>1.3 Research Question</div>\r\n<div>1.4 Significance Of Study</div>\r\n<div>1.5 Scope &amp; Limitations of Study</div>\r\n<div>1.6 Definition of Terms</div>\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n<div>CHAPTER TWO</div>\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n<div>Literature Review</div>\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n<div>2.1 Historical Development of Insurance</div>\r\n<div>2.2 Insurance Market</div>\r\n<div>2.3 Benefits of Insurance</div>\r\n<div>2.4 Classes of insurance</div>\r\n<div>2.5 Claims Settlement</div>\r\n<div>2.6 General Claims Procedure</div>\r\n<div>2.7 Conditions under which Insurer may refuse to settle claims</div>\r\n<div>2.8 Exception clauses relieving the Insurer from Liabilities when claim is filed.</div>\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n<div>Reference</div>\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n<div>CHAPTER THREE</div>\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n<div>3.0 Methodology and Research Design</div>\r\n<div>3.1 Sources of Data</div>\r\n<div>3.2 Description of Population</div>\r\n<div>3.3 Sampling Procedure</div>\r\n<div>3.4 Instrument of Data Collection</div>\r\n<div>3.5 Data collection Procedure</div>\r\n<div>3.6 Statistical method of Analysis</div>\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n<div>Reference</div>\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n<div>CHAPTER FOUR</div>\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n<div>Data Presentation and Analysis of Data</div>\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n<div>CHAPTER FIVE</div>\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n<div>Summary of Findings/Recommendations and Conclusion</div>\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n<div>5.1 Summary of findings</div>\r\n<div>5.2 Recommendation</div>\r\n<div>5.3 Conclusion</div>\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n<div>Bibliography</div>\r\n<div>Appendix</div>', '', '5', 'Year 4', '10', '5', 'Yes', 1, 23, 'paid', 5000, 'AN APPRAISAL OF THE INSURANCE COMPANIES APPROACH TO CLAIM SETTLEMENT (A CASE STUDY OF ENUGU STATE)', 1, 5, '2025-05-22 23:01:07', '2025-05-22 23:01:07', 'approved', 'an-appraisal-of-the-insurance-companies-approach-to-claim-settlement-a-case-study-of-enugu-state'),

Insurance is a pool of funds into which contributions are made and from which those who suffer loss are compensated.&nbsp;</div>\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n<div>As a contract, the insured and the insurer must be honest in all their dealings with each other. On the part of the insurer, he must be able, financially to settle all legitimate claims made on him as and when due. In the past, almost anyone, with or without experience and adequate capital could own an insurance company. As a result, most legitimate claims were not paid. This sad state of affairs was due largely to the &ldquo;freedom&rdquo; or rather, the absence of adequate Government supervision.&nbsp;</div>\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n<div>In other to stop this exploitation, the Government set up the &ldquo;J.C. Obande&rdquo; commission in 1961. Their report led to the 1961 insurance companies act, more decrees and acts followed leading to the present insurance Act of 2003.&nbsp;</div>\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n<div>In addition, from 1961 to date, the following regulatory bodies supervise the insurance industry they include; the Central Bank of Nigeria (C.B.N), the National Deposit Insurance Commission (N.D.I.C), the Securities &amp; Exchange Commission (SEC) and finally the National Insurance Commission (NAICOM) which plays a more direct role in the supervision of insurers. Each of these bodies performs functions aimed at regulating the insurance industry. An assessment of their performance will be made.&nbsp;</div>\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n<div>1.2 STATEMENT OF PROBLEM&nbsp;</div>\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n<div>For the pragmatist, the value of an idea (e.g. supervision of insurance) lies in its practical results. So, the questions is, how far and how well have the regulators performed?&nbsp;</div>\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n<div>1. Why is it necessary to regulate or supervise the insurance industry?</div>\r\n<div>2. How are insurers supervised?</div>\r\n<div>3. How effective is the supervision?&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</div>\r\n<div>4. Can supervision be made better?&nbsp;</div>\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n<div>1.3 OBJECTIVE OF STUDY</div>\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n<div>This research work has the following objectives:</div>\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n<div>1. To trace as far as possible, the origin of insurance</div>\r\n<div>2. To show the time and method of the introduction of insurance into Nigeria.</div>\r\n<div>3. The history and method of insurance supervision in Nigeria.</div>\r\n<div>4. The contribution of regulatory bodies to the insurance industry.&nbsp; &nbsp;</div>\r\n<div>5. To appraise their performance and determine if they have done well so far.&nbsp;</div>\r\n<div>6. Finally, to suggest how they can improve.&nbsp;</div>\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n<div>1.4 SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY&nbsp;</div>\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n<div>This project is intended to serve a number of purposes and all effort has been made to ensure that it has been written to meet these purposes.&nbsp;</div>\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n<div>1. This project will highlight the supervisory bodies and educate on their functions and mode of operation.</div>\r\n<div>2. To suggest ways of improving their effectiveness.&nbsp; &nbsp;</div>\r\n<div>3. Every research should ad to the volume of knowledge already accumulated. This project is not as exception.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n<div>1.5 RESEARCH HYPOTHESES&nbsp;</div>\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n<div>The following hypothesis were formed to achieve the objectives of the research.</div>\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n<div>1. Ho - The regulatory authorities are unable to carry out their roles and functions in the Nigerian insurance industry.</div>\r\n<div>H1 - The regulatory authorities are able to carry out their roles and function in the Nigeria insurance industry.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</div>\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n<div>2. Ho - The regulatory authorities did not contribute substantially to the manpower development in the insurance industry.&nbsp;</div>\r\n<div>H1 - The regulatory authorities have contributed to the manpower development in the insurance industry.&nbsp; &nbsp;</div>\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n<div>3. Ho &ndash; The regulatory authorities did not make the desired impact on the Nigeria Insurance Industry.&nbsp;</div>\r\n<div>H1 &ndash; The activities of the regulatory authorities have made the desired impact on the Nigeria Insurance Industry.&nbsp;</div>\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n<div>4. Ho &ndash; The activities of the regulatory authorities will not have future prospects in the Nigerian Insurance Industry.&nbsp;</div>\r\n<div>H1 &ndash; The activities of the regulatory authorities will not have future prospects in the Nigerian Insurance Industry.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</div>\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n<div>1.6 SCOPE AND LIMITATION&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</div>\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n<div>This project covers the regulatory bodies of the Nigerian Insurance Industry who they are, their functions, roles and their performance. The limiting factors experienced by the researcher are; difficulty in obtaining relevant material, money was not enough to conduct a thorough research&nbsp; and finally, the researcher did not have enough time to do a thorough job.&nbsp;</div>\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n<div>1.7 DEFINITION OF TERMS</div>\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n<div>1. C.B.N: The Central Bank of Nigeria is the apex financial institution which is charged with the responsibility of managing the cost, volume, availability and direction of money and credit in an economy with a view to achieving some desired economic objectives.

Insurance Market: This is an institutionalized arrangement for bringing together people who have the need transfer their risks and those willing to assure such risks subject to certain terms and condition.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</div>\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n<div>5. Indemnity: This is got from the Latin word &ldquo;indimidim&rdquo; and it means to put the insured &ldquo;back&rdquo; in the condition he was before he suffered a loss i.e. indemnity means to compensate.</div>\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n<div>6. Contract: An agreement between two or more parties which is binding at law e.g. insurance.</div>\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n<div>7. Intermediaries: These are the agents who act as facilitators in arranging insurance contractual relationship between the insured and the insurers. They are awarded by payment of commission.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</div>\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n<div>8. NAICOM: National Insurance Commission which was established by military decree on January 10, 1997 to ensure the effective administration, supervision, regulation and control of insurance business in Nigeria.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</div>\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n<div>9. NIA: The Nigeria Insurers Association is a trade association of registered insurance companies in Nigeria.&nbsp;</div>\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n<div>10. Policy: This is a document which is the evidence of the contract between the insured and the insurer.</div>\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n<div>11. Premium: This is the financial consideration the policyholder gives to the insurer in exchange for the compensation he receives when he (the insured) suffers a loss.</div>\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n<div>12. Risk: This is the possibility of a loss occurring.</div>\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n<div>13. Reserve: A proportion of profit which is set aside for emergencies by a business.&nbsp;</div>\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n<div>14. Sanction: This is a form of punishment that can be used if someone breaches a rule of law guiding his or her actions.</div>\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n<div>15. Underwriting: The process of assessing a risk proposed for insurance and fixing proper premium rates by an expert known as an underwriter.&nbsp;</div>', '<p>Business is too important to be left to &ldquo;Business-men&rdquo; to run and operate as they see fit. Moreso, if that &ldquo;business&rdquo; is that of insurance. The average Nigerian might not know much about insurance but he or she knows that insurance companies &ldquo;don&rsquo;t pay claims&rdquo;.</p>\r\n<p>In otherwords, the insurance industry has a bad image. This was the reason behind the federal governments creation of different insurance regulatory bodies. To prevent &ldquo;quacks from doing insurance business and to protect the insuring public, insurance laws and regulatory bodies have been created to further protect the insuring public. &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>The question now is, who are these regulatory bodies? How do they operate and how effective are they in performing their duties? This project in addition to &ldquo;appraising&rdquo; these regulatory bodies, will trace the genesis of regulating insurance business and finally, make recommendations on how the regulatory bodies can do better.&nbsp;</p>', '<div>TABLE OF CONTENT</div>\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n<div>Title page</div>\r\n<div>Approval page</div>\r\n<div>Dedication</div>\r\n<div>Acknowledgement</div>\r\n<div>Abstract</div>\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n<div>CHAPTER ONE</div>\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n<div>Introduction</div>\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n<div>1.1 Background of study</div>\r\n<div>1.2 Statement of Problem</div>\r\n<div>1.3 Objective of study</div>\r\n<div>1.4 significance of the study</div>\r\n<div>1.5 Research hypotheses</div>\r\n<div>1.6 Scope and limitation&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</div>\r\n<div>1.7 Definition Of Terms</div>\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n<div>CHAPTER TWO</div>\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n<div>Literature Review</div>\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n<div>2.1 Origin Of Insurance</div>\r\n<div>2.2 History of insurance in Nigeria</div>\r\n<div>2.3 The structure of the insurance market</div>\r\n<div>2.4 The beginning of insurance supervision</div>\r\n<div>2.5 The agents of insurance regulation</div>\r\n<div>2.6 Reasons and objective of regulating the insurance business</div>\r\n<div>2.7 The national insurance commission (NAICOM)</div>\r\n<div>2.8 The impact of regulatory control/agents</div>\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n<div>CHAPTER THREE</div>\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n<div>Data presentation and analysis</div>\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n<div>3.1 Analytical techniques</div>\r\n<div>3.2 Testing the hypothesis</div>\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n<div>Reference</div>\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n<div>CHAPTER FOUR</div>\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n<div>Findings, conclusion and recommendations</div>\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n<div>4.1 Summary of findings.</div>\r\n<div>4.2 Conclusion of the study</div>\r\n<div>4.3 Recommendation&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</div>\r\n<div>4.4 Suggestions for further study</div>\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n<div>Bibliography</div>\r\n<div>Appendix</div>', '', '4', 'Year 4', '10', '5', 'Yes', 1, 23, 'paid', 5000, 'AN APPRAISAL OF THE ROLE OF REGULATORY BODIES IN THE NIGERIAN INSURANCE INDUSTRY ', 1, 5, '2025-05-23 09:57:44', '2025-05-23 09:57:44', 'approved', 'an-appraisal-of-the-role-of-regulatory-bodies-in-the-nigerian-insurance-industry'),
